                <li>
                    Born in 1937, he is a scion of the Tata family, and son of Naval Tata who was adopted by Sir Ratan
                    Tata son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata Group.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He joined his company in 1961 when he used to work on the shop floor of Tata Steel, and was the
                    apparent successor to J. R. D. Tata upon the latter's retirement in 1991.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till the 8th class, followed by Cathedral and John Connon
                    School, Mumbai and at Bishop Cotton School in Shimla,[10] and, in 1955, graduated from Riverdale
                    Country School in New York City
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit, over 50 times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to
                    acquire Corus
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ratan Tata received the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and Padma Vibhushan in 2008, the third and second
                    highest civilian honours awarded by the Government of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 2011, Ratan Tata stated, "I came close to getting married four times and each time I backed off
                    in fear or for one reason or another." Ratan Tata stated recently that he loved one girl in Los
                    Angeles while working there. As his family member was ill, so he had to return to India but the
                    parents of the girl didn't allow her to come to India with Tata. So Tata stood by his commitment and
                    never married.
